# 3D-Engine
This is just a fun side project I'm doing during the summer. I'm posting this so that I don't lose any progress if I do something stupid to it in a new update.
I'm using this project, as well, to practice applied linear algebra and some other mathematical concepts; might make another one after that uses Quaternions instead of matrices

Right now it just renders points and lines, but eventually I hope for this to be some sort of 3D animation software

NOTE: In it's current state, you can only look left and right since adding different rotation matrices together is complicated and I have yet to add that functionality

CONTROLS:
W: Move forward
A: Move left
S: Move backward
D: Move right

J: Turn left
L: Turn right
